A project was developed to work with api https://rickandmortyapi.com. The application allows you to get data about characters, locations and episodes. Search is available both within the received list of api by parameter name and by a search request directly with any user parameters (example name = ricky & status = alive). Various approaches have been applied like HOC, functional/class components, sass, webpack, babel, react/redux, routing,historypromise, etc.

to start:
